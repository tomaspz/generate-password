# generate-password

I created an application to generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. 
This app runs in the browser and is  updated dynamically with JavaScript code to change HTML and CSS. 
It has a clean and polished user interface.
The page is responsive and adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This application is perfect for an employee with access to sensitive data.
It will randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria, which is specified by the user input.
It creates a strong password for a much greater security

Procedure:

1.- The user clicks the button "Generate Password" to generate a password
2.- The user gets a series of prompts for password criteria:
        2.1- length of the password: the user must choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
        2.2- special characters
        2.3- lowercase characters
        2.4- uppercase characters
        2.5- numeric characters
3.- The user input is validated. At least one character type should be selected
4.- After all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
5.- The password is displayed on the page

# Generate a Random Password

I created an application that generates a random password based on user selected criteria. 

* This app runs in the browser. 
* HTML and CSS are updated dynamically with JavaScript code. 
* The user interface is clean, polished and intuitive for the user.
* The page is responsive and adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This application is perfect for an employee that has access to sensitive data.
This application will randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria (specified by the user input).
A strong password is created for the user for a much greater security.

Procedure:

1.- The user clicks the button "Generate Password" to generate a password

2.- The user gets a series of prompts for password criteria:

        2.1- length of the password: the user must choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
                If the user inputs a password length that it is less than 8 or more than 128 characters, the user gets an                   alert message and the code asks the user again for the password length.
                
        2.2- special characters: the user can choose to include in the password special characters.
        
        2.3- lowercase characters: the user can choose to include in the password lower case characters.
        
        2.4- uppercase characters: the user can choose to include in the password upper case characters.
        
        2.5- numeric characters: the user can choose to include in the password numeric characters.
        
3.- After all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

5.- The password is displayed on the page and the user can copy and paste the strong password.
